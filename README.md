For the first TOP mini project I will attempt to recreate the Google homepage.
This will actually be attempt #2.

So this is my attempt at google home page. As you can see the icons on top are missing.
The nav and footer are pretty shoddy.
The searchbar is missing icons too.
These issues gave me lots of problems last time as well so I decided that maybe I'll have to revisit this project and clean it up once I gain more experience.

This attempt took me about ~4 hours. Not the worst.
